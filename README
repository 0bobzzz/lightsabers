Some beautiful code. They are extremely short, and extremely powerful.

* cps.ss - a simple CPS transformer.

* meta-interp.ss - a meta-circular interpreter (reflection tower).

* infer.ss - a type inferencer for the lambda calculus. It can infer
  infinite types (such as delta, omega, and the Y-combinator).

* mk-c.ss - a modified miniKanren implementation with a negation
  operator.

* interp-call-by-need.ss - a lazy interpreter

* interp-delim.ss - a simple interpreter with delimited continuation operators (shift/reset/shift0/reset0)

* encoding.scm - encodings of various things in the lambda calculus
